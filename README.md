Hi, my name is Eric Cho and I am an alum of The University of Georgia with a bachelors in Computer Science.

A quick intro below:

I started coding in 2016 and working as a software engineer quickly became my goal. Between then and graduating, I had the 
opportunity to work for the university as a calculus tutor in 2017, participate in the Exchange Program at the National 
University of Singapore (NUS) in 2019, win 2nd place at UGA's hackathon*, and work in my first internship in 2020.

After graduating, I worked as a technical consultant and specialized in front end development in HTML/CSS/JS. 
For 2022, I started this Github to show my progress with learning React and Node.js.

Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, friends, and my dog. I also enjoy colecting sneakers and recently 
got into the hobby of building custom mechanical keyboards in 2020, shoutout to TaehaTypes :)

Thanks for reading :)
